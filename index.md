## FAQ (of course, no one asked those questions except the first one)
- Why is it needed at all?
The tileset editor UI in Godot 3 is not convinient to express it lightly. And copying the same 4 corners for 47 * 4 times was too boring, everytime hunting for a pixel makes eyes bleed. So here it is.
- What are the alternatives?
Check out Tilesetter, it looks good. Maybe, if I found it before making TilePipe, I would not even start with.
- Is it opensource?
No, but may become in the future. 
- Is it paid?
No, but there is a possibility to having a Pro version with export to GameMaker and Unity.
