- Create tilesets for move zones and other highlights for 2d and 3d turn-based games.
- Create sipmle tilesets for pixelart platformers.
- Create not game-ready tilesets, but tileset drafts to later modify and tweak in grahical editor

Here is how the UI looks now, if you have questions how to use it, check out Documentation:

## FAQ:
(_of course, no one asked those questions except the first one_)

#### Why is it needed at all?
The tileset editor UI in Godot 3 is not convinient to express it lightly. And copying the same 4 corners for 47 * 4 times was too boring, everytime hunting for a pixel makes eyes bleed. So here it is.
#### What are the alternatives?
Check out Tilesetter, it looks good. Maybe, if I found it before making TilePipe, I would not even start with it.
#### Is it opensource?
No, but may become in the future. 
#### Is it paid?
No, but there is a possibility to having a Pro version with export to GameMaker and Unity.
