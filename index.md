## FAQ:
(_of course, no one asked those questions except the first one_)

### Why is it needed at all? - 
The tileset editor UI in Godot 3 is not convinient to express it lightly. And copying the same 4 corners for 47 * 4 times was too boring, everytime hunting for a pixel makes eyes bleed. So here it is.
### What are the alternatives? - 
Check out Tilesetter, it looks good. Maybe, if I found it before making TilePipe, I would not even start with it.
### Is it opensource? - 
No, but may become in the future. 
### Is it paid? - 
No, but there is a possibility to having a Pro version with export to GameMaker and Unity.
