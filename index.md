# About TilePipe

This site is here since the purpose and usage of the program is not obvious to everyone who might find it useful. What can it be used for?
- Create and modify tilesets fast during a jam.
- Create tilesets for move zones and other highlights for 2d and 3d turn-based games.
- Create sipmle tilesets for pixelart platformers.
- Create not game-ready tilesets, but tileset drafts to later modify and tweak in grahical editor

You can download the program from itch.io, it's free

## FAQ:
(_of course, no one asked those questions except the first one_)

#### Why is it needed at all?
The tileset editor UI in Godot 3 is not convinient to express it lightly. And copying the same 4 corners for 47 * 4 times was too boring, everytime hunting for a pixel makes eyes bleed. So here it is.
#### What are the alternatives?
Check out Tilesetter, it looks good. Maybe, if I found it before making TilePipe, I would not even start with it.
#### Is it opensource?
No, but may become in the future. 
#### Is it paid?
No, but there is a possibility to having a Pro version with export to GameMaker and Unity.
